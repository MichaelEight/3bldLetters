# 3bldLetters

## Usage
- Download the newest release
- **Make sure 3bldLetters.exe and WordsDatabase.xlsx are in the same folder!** (otherwise the app won't load the words)
- Input letters in any form ('ABCDE' or 'AB CD E' or 'ABC DE' -- it will work either way). You can move around input boxes using arrows on the keyboard
- Press button 'Next' or Enter on keyboard to change letters into words
- You can edit words in the WordsDatabase.xlsx (open it as an Excel file). **Note:** only words between B2 and Y25 will be loaded

## Features

## Coming soon
